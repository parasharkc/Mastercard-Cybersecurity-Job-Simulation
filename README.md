# Mastercard-Cybersecurity-Job-Simulation



## Objective

The job simulation aimed to identify and prevent security risks with Mastercard Security Awareness Team. 
Educate Mastercard staff on identifying and reporting phishing threats to mitigate the risk of cyberattacks.
Develop phishing simulation campaigns that realistically mimic cyberattacks, to assess employee awareness and readiness.
Analyze simulation results to identify gaps in phishing awareness across different business units and departments.
Design targeted training based on simulation outcomes, aimed at improving cybersecurity awareness.
Communicate findings and action points effectively to staff and stakeholders to foster a culture of proactive threat management.



### Skills Learned

- Phishing Threat Detection & Prevention: Developed a deeper understanding of phishing tactics and how to design realistic phishing emails.
- Incident Response: Improved ability to assess and respond to phishing attacks, ensuring timely actions are taken to prevent security breaches.
- Data Analysis: Gained skills in analyzing phishing simulation results to uncover patterns, trends, and areas needing improvement.
- Cybersecurity Training & Awareness: Developed the ability to design and deliver targeted cybersecurity training, focusing on areas with the highest risk.
- Effective Communication: Enhanced my capacity to communicate technical concepts clearly to non-technical stakeholders through presentations and training materials.


### Tools Used

- Phishing Simulation Platforms: Used simulated phishing tools to send fake phishing emails to employees and track their responses.
- Data Analysis Software: Analyzed campaign results using internal tools to measure success and identify patterns.
- Presentation Tools: Used software like PowerPoint or Google Slides to design concise, visual, and action-oriented presentations.
- Communication Tools: Used internal communication platforms to disseminate findings and conduct training sessions.

## Steps

Task 1: Design a phishing email simulation - As an analyst on our Security Awareness Team, you will support the Chief Security Officer (CSO) by helping staff identify and report security threats. A key responsibility will be mitigating phishing threats through education and awareness initiatives. You will design and execute monthly phishing simulation campaigns, sending realistic phishing emails to test employees' ability to recognize and respond to threats. Based on the results of these simulations, you will analyze staff performance and develop targeted training programs to improve overall security awareness across the organization.


-To encourage the user to click on the link, we followed a strategic approach to crafting a convincing phishing email. First, we added context at the beginning, making the content relevant to a Mastercard employee. We then masked the hyperlink within the text to avoid drawing attention to the suspicious link. Ensuring correct spelling and grammar throughout, we also incorporated elements of legitimacy to make the email appear authentic and trustworthy, increasing the chances of user engagement.

Task 2: Interpret phishing simulation results - The task is to identify which areas of the business require increased awareness about phishing risks. Based on the findings, design and implement targeted training programs for those teams to reduce the risk of an attack. Additionally, create a concise presentation to help improve security awareness within these teams.

-The above phishing emails are sent to all of the departments within the Mastercard. Weâ€™ve used some tools to analyze the results and we can see the failure rate of each department.


Email open rate = the percentage of people that opened it

Email click-through rate = the percentage of people that clicked on the link

Phishing success rate = the percentage of people that clicked the link and inputted some personal information

Now, we create the presentation to spread awareness within the departments. The task is to create a clear and concise presentation that heavily incorporates visuals and contextual examples to help identify phishing emails.Ensure the presentation is visually engaging and provides clear, actionable steps for the audience to follow.

### Conclusion
This simulation allowed me to work hands-on with phishing threat detection, cybersecurity awareness training, and incident response. By creating realistic phishing emails, analyzing the outcomes, and designing training, I played a crucial role in improving the overall cybersecurity posture of the organization. The project strengthened my data analysis, problem-solving, and communication skills, making me more proficient in addressing cyber threats and empowering teams with the knowledge to detect and prevent attacks. This experience has greatly enhanced my readiness to contribute to real-world cybersecurity efforts in similar roles.
